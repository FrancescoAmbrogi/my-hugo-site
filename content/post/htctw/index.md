## Overview
On February 2021 I was selected by Queen's University as part of the Teaching Team for the incredible [How to Change the World](https://www.htctw.org/) program. This was my very first experience with HTCTW, an experience I will never forget.

[HTCTW](https://www.htctw.org/) is an educational program to be thought as a Learning Journey. Hundreds of studends from everywhere in the world have the chance to work together in Teams to collaboratively tackle the world's most important challenges as defined by the United Nations.

As it is well described in the linkedIn [page](https://www.linkedin.com/company/htctw), HTCTW has three main aims:

1. Expand the availability and increase the accessibility of our learning journey. 

2. Support universities and colleges to integrate our experiential learning into their curriculum.

3. Support the growing community of alumni and partners with implementing real change.

I have to say that the pandemic put all of us through a lot of challenges, but it also gave rise to new opportunities. In these 5 days of intense learning experience I have seen students from all over the world, working together in teams, and brainstorming wonderful ideas to tackle the development goals. This has absolutely NO price!!

Thank you HTCTW, it was both an honor and a pleasure to be part of the community.
