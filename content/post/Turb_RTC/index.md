## Overview
On March 23rd 2021 I was invited by the Rotaract Club Strada dei Castelli to deliver a short lecture on Turbulence. It was both an honor and a pleasure to have this opportunity. Before moving to Canada I was an active member of the Club and it was such a great emotion to meet some of my old friends and colleagues again.

I was very surprised to see that a topic so difficult to grasp and complex such as Turbulence gathered so much attention from the audience. I am glad I was able to share a litle bit of my passion and work with everyone. See you all very soon!
